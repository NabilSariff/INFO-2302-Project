+ # Project Description: 
  WeTour is the tourism’s website liable for the best trip plans in Bangladesh. We elect tourism because it features a great potential to accelerate progress across
  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). If well managed, the world can generate quality jobs for durable growth, reduce poverty and offer incentives for 
  environmental conservation, a triple win to assist countries transition towards more inclusive, resilient economies. We are expecting to learn more about tourism 
  and the sustainable development goals (SDGs) throughout this journey.
  
    This website is mainly about Bangladesh, a country of South Asia, located within the delta of the Padma (Ganges) and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) rivers within the northeastern 
  part of the Indian subcontinent. It will be not a usual visit here because Bangladesh is one among the foremost densely populated countries within the world and its 
  people are predominantly Muslim. As a country filled with colour, life, sound and vibrancy, photographers will find no shortage of fabric to figure with, whether they 
  be extraordinary river landscapes or dozens of lovely faces, all of whom are rather wanting to be photographed. The big reason everyone got to visit Bangladesh is because 
  the people of Bangladesh are famously friendly and welcoming. It's fascinating to travel through a country and know that you are basically the only one among your kind around. 
  This means you are noticed.

    Our website promotes the beauty of Bangladesh and the famous tourist spots such as Cox Bazaar, Chittagong, Srimangal and many more. Each with their own unique attraction. 
  We help tourists plan their journey in exploring Bangladesh so that they can have the vacation of a lifetime.
